# HtmlMuse.Tokenizer (Work in Progress)

**HtmlMuse.Tokenizer** is a lightweight HTML tokenizer library written in C#. It provides functionality to tokenize HTML code and extract individual tokens. The tokenizer serves as a fundamental building block for parsing and analyzing HTML documents, paving the way for the creation of a comprehensive Document Object Model (DOM) or parse tree.

## </> HTML Living Standard

This tokenizer follows the **HTML Living Standard** specification. The **HTML Living Standard** is a comprehensive specification that defines the syntax and parsing rules for HTML. It provides a set of states and behaviors that the tokenizer must adhere to when tokenizing HTML code. You can find the complete **HTML Living Standard** specification [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html).

## üîé Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust HTML tokenizer using C#. The tokenizer acts as a state machine, consuming input characters and transitioning between different states according to the HTML specification.

The project is currently a work in progress, and the following tasks are planned:

- ‚òê Implement all the tokenizing states defined in the HTML Living Standard specification.
- ‚òê Develop unit tests to ensure correct behavior.
- ‚òê Refine and optimize the tokenizer algorithm.
- ‚òê Utilize the tokenizer to build a robust and feature-rich HTML parser

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use HtmlMuse.Tokenizer to tokenize an HTML document:

```csharp
using HtmlMuse.Tokenizer;

string htmlCode = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><!-- HTML MUSE --><h1>Happy, <br/>Tokenizing!</h1></body></html>";

// Create an HtmlTokenizer instance
HtmlTokenizer tokenizer = new HtmlTokenizer(htmlCode);

// Retrieve all tokens
List<Token> tokens = tokenizer.GetAllTokens();

// Iterate through the tokens
foreach (Token token in tokens)
{
    Console.WriteLine(token);
}

```

#### Output:

```shell
(DOCTYPE) -> Name: html,  PublicID: ,  SystemID: ,   ForceQuirks: False
(StartTag) -> TagName: html,  SelfClosing: False,  Attributes: 0
(StartTag) -> TagName: body,  SelfClosing: False,  Attributes: 0
(Comment) -> Data:  HTML MUSE
(StartTag) -> TagName: h1,  SelfClosing: False,  Attributes: 0
